An incredibly useful and meaningful web app. Check it out at [is anyone turning up?](http://isanyoneturningup.com)

Searches Twitter for people who have recently tweeted about 'turning up' and drops a pin on the map for their tweet's coordinates.

You could use the display code with any search term on Twitter, as long as there are geolocated tweets to be found.

Turn up!
